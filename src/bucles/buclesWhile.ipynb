    "Imagine you are going to create an application in which users will type a list of planet names. After users type in the names, it will show them the results again. This scenario will require users to be prompted multiple times for values, and when they are done, the code will display all the data in the list. In this module, we'll explore how you can use while and for loops to create this application.\n",

    "When writing code, a common challenge is that you perform a task an unknown number of times. In this unit, you want to allow a user to write a list of planet names. Unfortunately, you don't know how many names the user will type. To allow looping an unknown number of times, you can use a while loop.\n",

    "Find another line in a file.\n",

    "Check if a user has finished entering values.\n",
