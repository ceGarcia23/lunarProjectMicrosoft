Module: Using "while" and "for" loops in Python

Summary

In this module, you have created an application that asks users to type a list of planet names, stores them, and then displays them.

Since he didn't know how many planets users would type in, he used a while loop.

While loops are used to execute a block of code while a condition is True.

You have stored each planet name in a list.

After creating the list of planets, you used a for loop to iterate through it.

For loops are used with lists and other iterable objects to execute code a known number of times, once for each element of the list of planet names.

In this module, you have learned how to: Identify when to use a while loop or a for loop. Use a while loop to execute a task multiple times, as long as a given condition remains True.

Use a for loop to iterate through the data in the list.




DATA MANAGEMENT WITH PYTHON DICTIONARIES

Summary

Most programs need more complex data than string and number values.

In the scenario of this module, you have tried to work with information about the planets of the solar system.

This information included properties such as the number of moons and the circumference. Using dictionaries, you have been able to create a variable to store all the related data.

Then, you've used keys and values to interact directly with the data, without using key names to perform calculations. Python dictionaries are flexible objects, allowing you to model complex and related data.

In this module, you have learned how to: Identify when to use a dictionary. Create and modify data within a dictionary. Use dictionary methods to access dictionary data.
