Module: Using "while" and "for" loops in Python

Summary

In this module, you have created an application that asks users to type a list of planet names, stores them, and then displays them.

Since he didn't know how many planets users would type in, he used a while loop.

While loops are used to execute a block of code while a condition is True.

You have stored each planet name in a list.

After creating the list of planets, you used a for loop to iterate through it.

For loops are used with lists and other iterable objects to execute code a known number of times, once for each element of the list of planet names.

In this module, you have learned how to: Identify when to use a while loop or a for loop. Use a while loop to execute a task multiple times, as long as a given condition remains True.

Use a for loop to iterate through the data in the list.
